about: When there is a suspicious smudgeplot suggesting something wrong

**About your genome**

Tell us about your genome, so we understand why the smudgeplot seems to be wrong. Also please include the evidence you have (karyotype, inSitu...).

**smudgeplot**

Show us please the command you have used to generate the smudgeplot and the smudgeplot if possible. Tell us what looks suspicious on the smudgeplot and how do you expect it to look like?
